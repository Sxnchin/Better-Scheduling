# Better-Scheduling
A scheduler that is able to merge a bunch of your schedules, (school, work), and assign your list of tasks to your non-booked time
Views your meetings/classes as things that are not going to move. using these as reference, it gets your list of task's and 
places them in time, setting them up so you can do them. This removes the struggle of figuring out what to do next.
